# NEOs Comets AI

This project is an artificial intelligence application that analyzes and visualizes data from NEOs (Near-Earth Objects) and comets using data from NASA. The aim is to provide valuable insights into these objects and help researchers and astronomy enthusiasts better understand their trajectories and characteristics.

## Features

- Query data on NEOs and comets.
- Graphical visualization of object trajectories.
- Analysis of NEO hazard levels.
- User-friendly interface.
- Combine LLMs (Large Language Models) to "know" NEOs as if they were friends.
- Generate art based on the orbits of comets.
- Sample comet orbits to create melodies.
- Train LLMs using AI-generated audio for visually impaired individuals.
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit.
